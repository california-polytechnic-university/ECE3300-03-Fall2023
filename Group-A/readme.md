# JPEG Image Compression/Encryption - ECE 3300 Final Project
### *Completed by Aaron De Castro, Ethan Khoe, Shawn Keelin, Josh Madsen*
Our project contains the files necessary to process an image into a ".COE" Xilinx file, initialize BRAM on the Nexys-A7, compress it using the JPEG algorithm, and display it using the VGA output on the board.  We also created a second project that takes the loaded image and runs it through a seed (input from the first 7 switches) to encrypt the data.  The RGB values are altered and it changes the VGA display.

## Abstract
In the realm of FPGA-based image processing, this study delves into the Verilog implementation of a JPEG compression algorithm, focusing on the Nexys A7-100T model. The adaptation of crucial algorithmic elements, including discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, and Zigzag encoding, caters to the FPGA's parallel processing strengths. A nuanced exploration of the delicate interplay between compression ratio and visual quality is conducted, accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation of performance metrics. Throughout this journey, the paper navigates challenges encompassing BRAM storage optimization, RGB to YCbCr conversion intricacies, and the pivotal color compression step for achieving a 12-bit RGB output. The downsampling technique efficiently shrinks image dimensions via dynamic BRAM utilization, while the upsampling counterpart meticulously restores the image to its original size. Tackling color compression complexities involves the strategic application of weighted averages, albeit with acknowledged imperfections. Synthesis reveals resource constraints, prompting a strategic pivot toward image data encryption. Here, a secure layer is introduced by XORing a secret key derived from board switches. In conclusion, the paper synthesizes findings on implementation efficacy and charts a course for potential design refinements, underscoring the FPGA's capacity for real-time image processing.
