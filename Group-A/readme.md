# JPEG Image Compression/Encryption - ECE 3300 Final Project
### *Completed by Aaron De Castro, Ethan Khoe, Shawn Keelin, Josh Madsen*
Our project contains the files necessary to process an image into a ".COE" Xilinx file, initialize BRAM on the Nexys-A7, compress it using the JPEG algorithm, and display it using the VGA output on the board.  We also created a second project that takes the loaded image and runs it through a seed (input from the first 7 switches) to encrypt the data.  The RGB values are altered and it changes the VGA display.
